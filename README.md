# Language Change

LanguageChange is a Python library for studying semantic change. It offers a complete pipeline, including these features:

* Load existing datasets and popular benchmarks or sample word usages from new or annotated data
* Generate word embeddings from static word models or large language models and use them with cluster algorithms   
* Measure change using standard metrics and 
* Graphical plots to analyse data and results, such as DWUGS
